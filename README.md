# LWC File Preview for Experience Cloud Community sites

A simple file preview using Lightning Web Component (LWC) with download capability. This LWC component currently only targeted **Experience Cloud Community sites**.

## Why I need this?

As you might know LWC standard file preview using [NavigationMixin](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/use_open_files) is not covers _Lightning Components for Visualforce, Lightning Out, or Experience Cloud sites_. This sample is a workaround to preview Salesforce files on Experience Cloud.

- Drag n drop "LWC File Preview" from component menu
